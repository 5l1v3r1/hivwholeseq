This folder contains two classes:

1. `SamplePat` in `samples.py` to study single samples
2. `Patient` in `patients.py` to study whole patients

and a number of scripts to visualize genetic features of samples/patients,
e.g. allele frequencies or haplotypes. Those scripts are actually used by
the classes, so do not delete them.
