PIPELINE FOR HIV MISEQ SEQUENCING DATA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. We get three FASTQ files from Joerg (and the Miseq):
 - R1 is read 2
 - R2 is adapter sequence
 - R3 is read 2

1. Demultiplex by adapter and put into separate folders with the adapter IDs and
   sample names. Create a subsample of demultiplexed adapters for consensus
   building. (demultiplex.py)

CHECKPOINT: errors in adapter IDs

2. Filter by quality and trim reads, for subsample and full dataset separately.
   (filter_trim_demultiplexed_reads.py)

CHECKPOINT: length distribution of trimmed reads

3. Recursive mapping of subsample onto HIV: HXB2 fragments first, then its own
   consensus. (mapping_subsample_recursive.py)

CHECKPOINT: mapping issues, coverage

4. Map the full dataset against the final self consensus.

5. Downstream: calculate allele frequencies, etc.
